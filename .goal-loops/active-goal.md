# Primary Goal

Unify all agents via the c2c instant messaging system — make it so that
Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Kimi, and Crush agents can send and receive
messages in real time, across 1:1 DMs and N:N group rooms, on the local
machine and across machines via relay.

## Group Goal Context

The broader group goal is larger than any single iteration.
These are Max's target experiences, verbatim:

### Delivery surfaces
- **c2c via MCP**: auto-delivery of inbound messages into the agent's
  transcript plus tool-path sending. Real auto-delivery requires the
  experimental `notifications/claude/channel` extension; on binaries
  where that's gated, the MCP surface stays polling-based via `poll_inbox`.
- **c2c via CLI**: fallback path usable by any agent, with or without MCP.
- **c2c CLI self-configuration**: the CLI turns on auto-delivery for any
  host client that supports it (no hand-editing settings files).

### Reach
- Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Kimi, Crush as first-class peers.
- Cross-client parity: a message from Codex to Kimi Just Works.
- Local-only today; broker design does not foreclose remote transport.

### Topology
- 1:1 ✓, 1:N ✓ (send_all), N:N ✓ (rooms: join_room, send_room, etc.)
- `swarm-lounge` is the default social room; all clients auto-join.
- `c2c init` / `c2c join <room>`, discoverable peers, sensible defaults.

### Social layer
- Persistent social channel for agents to coordinate and reminisce.
  Room identity and history support this.

## Current Status (updated 2026-04-14, storm-ember)

### Satisfied (all AC met)

- **Claude Code** ↔ Codex ↔ OpenCode ↔ Kimi ↔ Crush: 1:1 DM proven for all live pairs.
- **Claude Code**: PostToolUse hook auto-delivers broker inbox per tool call.
  Fast path ~3ms (bash builtin); stable alias via `C2C_MCP_AUTO_REGISTER_ALIAS`.
- **Codex**: managed harness (`run-codex-inst-outer`) + `c2c_deliver_inbox --notify-only`
  loop; `c2c setup codex` for one-command onboarding.
- **OpenCode**: native TypeScript plugin (`.opencode/plugins/c2c.ts`) PROVEN
  end-to-end (59c0909, 2026-04-14). Plugin background-polls broker, delivers via
  `client.session.promptAsync`. DM drain + promptAsync confirmed; opencode-local
  replied to Codex's probe. PTY wake daemon is fallback only. Spool file retries
  failed promptAsync; spool injected into managed restart prompt (9cc5663).
  JSON parse bug fixed (da78130): `parsePollResult()` unwraps CLI JSON envelope.
- **Kimi**: managed harness (`run-kimi-inst-outer`) + wake daemon.
  PTY wake proven; kimi-nova↔opencode-local DM roundtrip proven. All Kimi↔
  {Claude, Codex, OpenCode} pairs proven 2026-04-13.
- **Rooms** ✓: `join_room`, `send_room`, `room_history`, `my_rooms`,
  `list_rooms`, `leave_room`. `swarm-lounge` is active. Sweep evicts dead
  room members.
- **Dead-letter + auto-redelivery** ✓: swept sessions recover queued messages
  on re-register. Matched by session_id OR alias.
- **Broker-gc** ✓: daemon sweeps dead registrations; `c2c sweep` CLI;
  `c2c dead-letter` for orphan inspection and pruning.
- **Cross-machine relay** ✓: 6 phases complete (InMemoryRelay → SQLite backend,
  HTTP relay server, connector sync, rooms, GC daemon, exactly-once dedup).
  `c2c relay serve/connect/setup/status/list/gc/rooms`. Tested in-process.
- **Liveness hardening** ✓: `pid_start_time` defeats PID reuse. POSIX `fcntl.lockf`
  interlocks OCaml broker + Python writers. Alias-occupied guard prevents
  one-shot probes from evicting live peer registrations. Explicit `register`
  tool rejects alias hijack by alive different-session (actionable error,
  own-alias refresh always allowed). `maybe_auto_register_startup` adds
  `hijack_guard` and `alias_occupied_guard`; alias allocation uses session_id
  as seed so sessions start at different offsets in the ~17K pool. See finding
  2026-04-14T04-00-00Z-storm-beacon-alias-hijack-register-guard.md.
- **`C2C_MCP_CLIENT_PID`** ✓: all managed launchers (kimi, crush, codex,
  opencode) pin the broker's liveness target to the durable outer-loop PID.
- **OCaml broker** ✓: 110 tests; sweep, rooms, dead-letter, alias dedup,
  peer-renamed fan-out, session hijack guard, alias-occupied guard,
  alias-hijack register guard, dead-pid fallback in `current_client_pid()`.
- **Python suite** ✓: 832 tests across all subsystems.
- **Broker.register fresh entries** ✓: fixed `Broker.register` so first-time
  registrations are prepended rather than silently dropped after the match
  refactor (3824610).
- **c2c history env resolution** ✓: `c2c history` now resolves session IDs from
  all five managed outer-loop env vars, including OpenCode, Kimi, and Crush.
- **Room rename alias drift** ✓: register renames propagate to room memberships;
  `join_room` deduplicates by both alias and session_id; auto-join prefers the
  current registered alias over stale env aliases (1fb4b6c, 2026-04-14).
- **Kimi Wire bridge** ✓: `c2c_kimi_wire_bridge.py` + `c2c-kimi-wire-bridge` wrapper;
  42 tests pass; `run_once_live` subprocess path implemented and **live-proven
  2026-04-14** by codex with a real `kimi --wire` subprocess (delivered 1 broker
  message, cleared spool, rc=0; see finding
  `2026-04-13T16-10-03Z-codex-kimi-wire-live-once-proof.md`). Native JSON-RPC
  delivery via `kimi --wire` without PTY injection. `run_loop_live` + `--daemon`
  polls cheaply and starts Wire only when inbox/spool work exists, with pidfile
  and log support for detached operation.
- **Kimi wake daemon** ✓: basic and idle-at-prompt TUI wake proven via the
  master-side `pty_inject` backend. Kimi uses a longer default submit delay
  (1.5s) so prompt_toolkit accepts and submits the notify-only poll prompt.
  Direct `/dev/pts/<N>` slave writes are display-side only and must not be used
  as an interactive input path (see finding
  2026-04-13T16-12-18Z-codex-kimi-pts-slave-write-not-input.md).
- **Kimi Wire Bridge** ✓: native JSON-RPC delivery via `kimi --wire` implemented
  and **live-proven 2026-04-14** by `kimi-nova`. Auto-registration, inbox drain,
  Wire `prompt` delivery, and spool clearing all confirmed working end-to-end
  (see finding 2026-04-14T02-27-00Z-kimi-nova-kimi-wire-bridge-live-proof.md).
  Persistent `--loop` and detached `--daemon` modes are implemented for daemon
  use. `c2c wire-daemon` lifecycle management subcommand added (start/stop/status/
  restart/list) with standard pidfile support (2026-04-14, storm-ember).
  This is Kimi's preferred native path; master-side PTY wake remains the
  manual TUI fallback.
- **Crush DM proof** ✓: `c2c setup crush` MCP config proven. One-shot
  `crush run` poll-and-reply delivery **live-proven 2026-04-14** by `kimi-nova`
  (see finding 2026-04-14T03-00-00Z-kimi-nova-crush-dm-proof.md). The
  normal `c2c send` broker enqueue path to Crush was also proven by Codex
  (see finding 2026-04-13T17-14-41Z-codex-crush-broker-send-proof.md). The
  interactive TUI wake path is now **live-proven for Codex<->Crush**: Codex sent
  a direct MCP DM, notify-only PTY wake prompted Crush to poll, and Crush replied
  by MCP with marker `CRUSH_INTERACTIVE_WAKE_ACK 1776101709` (see finding
  2026-04-13T17-35-58Z-codex-crush-interactive-tui-wake-proof.md).

### Satisfied (continued)

- **Cross-machine relay live test** ✓: localhost multi-broker test passed
  2026-04-14 (see finding 2026-04-14T02-06-00Z-kimi-nova-relay-localhost-
  multi-broker-test.md). Docker cross-machine equivalent test passed 2026-04-14
  (see finding 2026-04-14T02-16-00Z-kimi-nova-relay-docker-cross-machine-
  test.md). True two-machine Tailscale test passed 2026-04-14 with `x-game` ↔
  `xsm` over real network (see finding 2026-04-14T02-37-00Z-kimi-nova-relay-
  tailscale-two-machine-test.md).
- **Site visual redesign** ✓: Max approved without sign-off gate. Redesign
  shipped with deep-space dark theme, electric cyan + magenta accents,
  glass-morphism cards, mesh-gradient hero, pulse animations, card-grid
  features, and Inter typography (2026-04-14).
- **c2c smoke-test** ✓: `c2c smoke-test [--broker-root DIR] [--json]` — end-to-end
  broker verification command. Seeds synthetic sessions, sends a marker message,
  polls, and verifies delivery. 12 Python tests. `smoke-test` is in
  SAFE_AUTO_APPROVE_SUBCOMMANDS. Ships in Python CLI (2026-04-14, storm-beacon).
- **Missing sender alias errors** ✓: OCaml v0.6.6. `send`, `send_all`, `send_room`,
  `join_room`, `leave_room` now return structured `isError:true` when called
  without a registered session AND without an explicit `from_alias`/`alias`
  argument, instead of crashing with a raw `Yojson__Safe.Util.Type_error`.
  Server feature flag `missing_sender_alias_errors` added. 2 new OCaml regression
  tests (3023473, 2026-04-14, storm-beacon).
- **Crush broker orphan kill** ✓: `run-crush-inst-outer` now scans `/proc` for
  `c2c_mcp_server` processes with matching `C2C_MCP_SESSION_ID` in environ and
  sends SIGTERM after each Crush exit. Prevents orphaned broker subprocess
  accumulation when Crush reparents to init instead of EOF (b02d921, 2026-04-14,
  storm-beacon).
- **`c2c health` broker binary check** ✓: `check_broker_binary()` reports OCaml
  broker binary path, freshness (binary vs source mtime), and source version from
  `ocaml/c2c_mcp.ml`. Human-readable output with stale/fresh indicator. 3 Python
  tests. `c2c health` now shows `✓ Broker binary: v0.6.6 (binary is up-to-date)`
  (cbde925 + 3806fd9, 2026-04-14, storm-beacon).
- **`c2c verify --broker`** ✓: broker-archive-based verification mode. Reads
  `<broker_root>/archive/*.jsonl` instead of Claude session transcripts — works
  across all client types (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Kimi, Crush). `received` from
  own archive; `sent` from cross-archive from_alias scan; c2c-system excluded;
  falls back to YAML registry when registry.json absent. `--alive-only` filters
  dead registrations. 10 new tests. Python suite 817 total (79feafc + cfbbb93,
  2026-04-14, storm-beacon).
- **Docs optional-alias updates** ✓: `docs/commands.md` and `docs/index.md`
  updated to reflect v0.6.6 change — `from_alias`/`alias` marked optional in all
  affected tools. Quick-start updated to show alias-free flow (1bfadf9 + 4681372,
  2026-04-14, storm-beacon).
- **`c2c status`** ✓: compact swarm overview command for agent orientation after
  resume/compaction. Reports alive peers, broker-archive sent/received counts,
  goal_met state, dead registration count, and room membership summaries.
  Also shows `last=Xs/Xm/Xh/Xd ago` per peer using max(last_recv, last_sent)
  so active senders with empty inboxes still show recent activity.
  22 status-focused Python tests; suite 840 total
  (1bf69c2 + f59f62f + d38396d + 85b7720, 2026-04-14, storm-beacon).

### Active Work

- No active delivery-proof blocker is currently recorded here. The next
  high-leverage work is product polish, per-pair Crush matrix expansion if
  desired, and keeping managed sessions healthy through restarts.

### Remaining Product Polish

- **Inbox drain progress indicator** ✓ — `c2c poll-inbox` text mode now prints
  `[c2c-poll-inbox] N message(s) for <session> (<source>)` before message bodies;
  JSON output gains a top-level `count` field. 3 new tests; current Python
  suite total is 804 (a01ce40 plus follow-up slices, 2026-04-14).
- **Room member liveness summaries** ✓ — `list_rooms` / `my_rooms` and
  `c2c room list --json` now include `alive_member_count`,
  `dead_member_count`, `unknown_member_count`, and `member_details` so stale
  room memberships are visible without running sweep.
- Room access control (invite-only, message visibility scopes) — future work.
- Native MCP push delivery — revisit `notifications/claude/channel` on future
  Claude builds.

## For Autonomous Agents Resuming This Session

When you resume, start by:
1. `mcp__c2c__poll_inbox` — drain your inbox
2. `mcp__c2c__whoami` — re-register if missing
3. Check `tmp_collab_lock.md` for active peer locks
4. Check `swarm-lounge` for recent swarm activity
5. Arm the inotifywait broker monitor (see CLAUDE.md Recommended Monitor setup)
6. Pick the highest-leverage unblocked work

**Do NOT call `mcp__c2c__sweep` while outer loops are running.**
Check: `pgrep -a -f "run-(kimi|codex|opencode|crush|claude)-inst-outer"`

Empty inbox is NOT a stop signal. Send a message to swarm-lounge with what
you're working on, pick up a slice, and keep going. The swarm lives as long
as at least one agent is active.

## Blockers / Notes

- **Crush** — `c2c setup crush` MCP config proven. One-shot `crush run`
  poll-and-reply proven 2026-04-14 (kimi-nova). Codex<->Crush live
  idle/active-session DM delivery proven 2026-04-13 with notify-only wake plus
  broker-native MCP poll/send. Managed harness + wake daemon exist; keep
  watching PID refresh because Crush processes rotate quickly.
- **OpenCode plugin promptAsync**: proven end-to-end 2026-04-14. Codex may still
  hold locks on plugin files; check `tmp_collab_lock.md` before editing.
- **Channel delivery**: `notifications/claude/channel` requires `experimental.claude/channel`
  in the client's `initialize` handshake. Standard Claude Code does not declare
  this; polling is the production delivery path. `C2C_MCP_AUTO_DRAIN_CHANNEL=0`
  is the correct setting (see findings).
