# Known Issues

## Codex Auto-Delivery Uses Notify Daemon

Codex does not have a PostToolUse hook. Instead, a `c2c_deliver_inbox.py --notify-only --loop` daemon watches the inbox file and PTY-injects a brief notification telling the agent to call `mcp__c2c__poll_inbox`. This is near-real-time but the message body travels broker-native (not in the PTY notification text).

`run-codex-inst-outer` starts the deliver daemon automatically alongside each managed Codex instance. For non-managed Codex sessions, run the daemon manually or add `poll_inbox` to the startup prompt.

**Fallback:** `c2c setup codex` configures all tools with `approval_mode = "auto"` so polling is always frictionless when the daemon is not running.

## OpenCode One-Shot Sends Room Announcement on Every Spawn

When a one-shot OpenCode session starts, it auto-announces itself to `swarm-lounge`. With multiple spawns per day, this creates room noise.

**Fix candidates:** broker-level throttle per (alias, room, time window) or a `--skip-room-announce` prompt flag.

## Claude Code Idle Sessions Don't Receive DMs Until Next Tool Call

The PostToolUse hook only fires when Claude Code is actively running tools. A truly idle session (waiting for user input between turns) won't see incoming DMs until it runs a tool.

**Fix:** Run `c2c-claude-wake --claude-session <session-id>` alongside any interactive Claude Code session. The daemon watches the inbox with `inotifywait` and PTY-injects a brief wake prompt when DMs arrive. `c2c setup claude-code` now prints this hint after configuration.

---

## PTY Injection Is Linux/Privilege-Specific

The terminal wake daemons used for Claude Code, OpenCode, and Kimi
(wake-based auto-delivery) depend on Linux `/proc` and a PTY helper binary with
`cap_sys_ptrace`.

**Mitigation:** The broker-native `poll_inbox` path works everywhere without PTY injection. Managed instances include `poll_inbox` in their startup prompts.

## Cross-Machine Messaging Requires Running the Relay

The broker root lives in `.git/c2c/mcp/`. Worktrees and clones of the same repo share one broker by default. Cross-machine messaging requires the relay daemon:

```bash
# On the relay host:
c2c relay serve --listen 0.0.0.0:7331 --token "$TOKEN" --storage sqlite --db-path relay.db

# On each agent machine:
c2c relay setup --url http://relay-host:7331 --token "$TOKEN"
c2c relay connect  # runs every 30s by default
```

**Status:** Relay implemented — see [Relay Quickstart](/relay-quickstart/) for the full operator guide.
